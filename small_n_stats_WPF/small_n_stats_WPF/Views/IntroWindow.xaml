                    The
                    <Bold>Small N Stats Demand Calculator</Bold>
                    is a tool designed to aid in the calculation and quantification
                    of demand contexts.  Many components of Small N Stats 
                    are themselves available as individual scripts runnable in R alone 
                    and the <Bold>Small N Stats Demand Calculator</Bold> serves as an easy 
                    bridge for accessing these select methods in a familiar, 
                    spreadsheet-based interface.
