Small N Stats Demand Calculator is a WPF application that uses R interop libraries (R.Net Community) to easily facilitate complex calculations required of behavior economic scientists.  
Features include:
  - Non-linear model fittings
  - Multiple Models available
  - Access to R-based graphics and R-based graphic capabilities
  - Input/output in common spreadsheet file formats (.xlsx, .csv)
