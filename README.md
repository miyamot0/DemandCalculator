# Small N Stats Demand Calculator
Small N Stats Demand Calculator is a WPF application that uses R interop libraries (R.Net Community) to easily facilitate complex calculations required of behavior economic (BE) scientists.  

Features include:
  - Non-linear model fittings (John Nash's modified LM optimizer, specificially suited for BE models)
  - Multiple Models available (Hursh & Silberberg's Exponential Model, Koffarnus et. al.'s Exponentiated model)
  - R-based graphical output in appropriate log space(s) (ggplot2)
  - Easily imports common file formats into the application's spreadsheet (.xlsx, .csv)
  - Full range of BE outcome metrics (empirical and derived), saveable in common spreadsheet file formats

### Installation
You will need the R open-source statistical package for model fitting/charting to be performed.
Once DemandCalculator is installed, it will perform a one-time install the necessary R packages (internet required).
DemandCalculator is a ClickOnce application, the program will automatically update as the program is refined.
